# Code Pal

Code Pal is a utility application written in C# designed to help developers with outlining, task tracking, and pseudocoding. It allows users to create "Task Lists" for to-dos and task tracking, and offers a feature-rich text editor for writing pseudocode. What sets Code Pal apart is its overlay functionality, which displays over any window. This, combined with its translucent and minimal design, enables users to reference their to-dos, notes, tasks, or pseudocode without needing another monitor, ALT-Tabbing, or extra devices.
